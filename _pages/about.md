## 🧐 About Me {#about-me}

👋 Hello, I am **Haoran Ma**, a graduate student at the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**, majoring in Electronic Information. I am currently in my **first** year of my master’s program at the **Miracle Lab**, under the guidance of Prof. S. Kevin Zhou.

I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), School of Information and Communication Engineering, where I majored in Electronic Information Engineering.

My research interests primarily lie in **multimodal learning and pre-training algorithms**, with a particular focus on their applications in **medical image analysis**. I am especially interested in algorithmic design, representation learning, and cross-modal modeling, and I am passionate about exploring the potential of these methods across different domains.

If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me via email at **haoranma@mail.ustc.edu.cn**.  
I am also actively seeking **algorithm-related research or industry internship opportunities**.
